    #  - 'auth' contains the base64 encoded credentials for the registry
    #    in JSON form {"username": "...", "password": "..."}
    #  - 'auth-refresh' specifies an interval for automatic retrieval of
    #    credentials; only for AWS ECR (see below)
    #  - 'skip-tls-verify' determines whether to skip TLS verification for the
    #    registry server (only for 'skopeo', see note below); defaults to false

    # 'from'. Additionally, the tags being synced for a mapping can be limited
    # by providing a 'tags' list. When omitted, all image tags are synced.
